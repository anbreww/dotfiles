Andrew's dotfile repository.

Usage : symlink appropriately from home folder to base directory.
(see install.rb script)

Files can now be modified, branched, merged etc withing the repo,
and changes synced between computers easily

TODO : update install script to check for existing files, prompt to backup, and create symlinks if they don't already exist
